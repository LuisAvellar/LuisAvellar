### Hi there 👋😁

My name is Luis Avellar from Brazil (🇧🇷). I work with Process Engineering. 
I am used to create some scientific codes with VBA, Fortran and Python, but I’m currently starting to learn Frontend and Backend with JS, HTML, CSS, React and so on.
I like to code and looking to implement those skills in my work.
If you want someone to make some technical codes (Engineering, mathematic..), contact me. Perhaps I could  help you.
In my free time I like to climb and hike as well as playing some strategy games on my desktop.
